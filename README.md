# sgallon-rin.github.io

This branch contains source code for my Github homepage.

I use [Hexo](https://hexo.io) as the framework for this site, and use the theme [Next](https://github.com/theme-next/hexo-theme-next).

If you'd like to set up your own Github page, you may want to check [Quickstart for Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart).

If you are interested in the details I build this site, please read [this post](https://sgallon-rin.github.io/2022/10/25/create-personal-website-with-hexo-and-github-pages/).
